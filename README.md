## Automated Search From Search Engines Of User's Choice
### Current Project Status:
On first running the project, a window opens up asking for the user's preferred search engine among 'Chrome' and 'Bing'. Based on the entered choice, the program moves onto the python terminal and asks for a user input which is searched through the entered search engine. An automated test window pops ups in the entered search engine, displaying the search results for the user's input.
